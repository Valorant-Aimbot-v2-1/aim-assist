## üèπ Overview

Valorant rewards precision, but not everyone can maintain perfect crosshair placement every round. With aim assist, your shots feel steadier, and combined with ESP wall vision, you‚Äôll always be prepared for incoming fights.

\[!IMPORTANT]
Keep your smoothing and FOV settings moderate if you want to avoid looking unnatural in ranked matches.
